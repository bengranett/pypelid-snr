Pypelid SNR Calculator
======================

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bengranett/pypelidcalc/master?urlpath=/apps/notebook/pypelid-snr.ipynb)

This is a graphical interface to the Pypelid code implemented in a Jupyter
notebook.  It may be used to simulate emission line galaxy spectra as observed
by a slitless spectrograph in order to estimate the detection signal to noise
and predict the redshift measurement error (both random and systematic).
